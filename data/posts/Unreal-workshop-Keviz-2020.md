I hosted an online unreal workshop in zoom. During the workshop different we discussed on different aspects inside the engine and explained the core logic between gamemode, player controler,gameinstances, pawn etc . Different projects which i worked in the past also where shocased during the event.


Participants from different background joined the event, there where multiple intrest in different possibilities inside the UE. Since it is lockdown due to pandemic event was hosted live via zoom.
